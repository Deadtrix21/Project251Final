            <h2>What is our Product?</h2>
            <p>
                  Our product system is a soil monitoring sensor with indicators
                  and a system that is enables farmers to save large amounts of
                  water and also allows users or farmers to analyse the soil
                  moisture in the regions where the sensor is active on the
                  farm. The main aim is for the system to save water and more
                  things but also we want to make sure all the plantlife have
                  sufficient water to maintain their growth maximum.

            <h2>Soil health importance</h2>
            <p>
                  Our country of diverse vegetaion, wildlife and human life all
                  have one place where we get a large percentage of our
                  necesarry water or food, the soil. The food production sector
                  is part of our agriculture. The main part to be more specific,
                  as this sector provides our Wholesalers with the products that
                  our day-to-day consumers make use of such as your fruit,
                  vegetables and grain and many more.One of the most important
                  aspects of soil fertility is the amount of pH in it. This is
                  controlled by Temperatures in the atmosphere, the amount of
                  water in the soil and few more but water and temperatures
                  being one of the more important ones.
            </p>

            <h2>Weather importance</h2>
            <p>
                  Our system relies on plenty of sources on data to determine
                  what exactly it needs to indicate. The most important one
                  being the weather as the conditions can already automate
                  certain tasks, for instate, if the sensor receives data from
                  our API that it will rain for most of the day, it can the
                  automate itself to not use the sprinkler sytem in order to
                  save water
