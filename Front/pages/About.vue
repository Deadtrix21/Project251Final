                        What motivated our team to do this project was to solve
                        a part of the problem for life on land as well as for
                        water resources. The product exsists to track the amount
                        of water that in the ground for the plants. The starting
                        price of our system just to setup the basics is R14 000
                        and can increase depending on the size of the area that
                        is covered. Our system is limited to static farming as
                        such as apples, grapes etc.

                  <p>
                        We strieve to reduce world hunger, promote agriculture
                        while eliminating agricultural export subsidies, develop
                        rural infrastructure and show that IT systems can be
                        used and adapted to grow a diversity of seeds.<br />

                        The project's final deliverable product analyses soil
                        moisture exclusively. It is fully dependent on the end
                        user to have an insight on the impact and effects of
                        current season, geographic location, soil type and soil
                        depth in relation to soil moisture levels.

                        It is recorded by the United Nations that global
                        pandemic has worsened world hunger and child
                        malnutrition. People worldwide are without food or
                        cannot maintain a healthy balanced diet. Through this
                        project, we aim achieve and contribute to ending world
                        hunger through the use and implementation of Information
                        Technology. We want to increase agricultural
                        productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers
                        by means of access to a secure agricultural area to
                        develop the maintenance of an ecosystem, and promote a
                        sustainable food production system that represents
                        resilient agricultural practices that lead to an
                        increased production and productivity. We introduce
                        indicators of achievement by collaborating our project
                        with developing the rural infrastructure to increase an
                        investment in rural development, and implementing a
                        management of water resources to restore sustainable
                        management of water.<br />

                        Implement the system to grow plants and develop
                        sustainable agriculture. Output: Feed people directly.
                        Outcome: Value-added agriculture for food producers to
                        expand on a product's revenue sources. Impact: The
                        project aims to reduce world hunger, promote agriculture
                        while eliminating agricultural export subsidies, develop
                        rural infrastructure and show that IT systems can be
                        used and adapted to grow a diversity of seeds.
